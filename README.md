# What-Affects-the-Number-of-Goals-a-FIFA-Player-Makes
This project analyzes FIFA World Cup (2018) and FIFA Womenâ€™s World Cup (2019) data to investigate the factors influencing the number of goals scored by players. The analysis uses both categorical (position, country, WorldCup/sex) and continuous (age, caps) predictors, with the primary response variable being the number of goals.
